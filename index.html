<h1> ðŸ’ž Happy Valentine's Day ðŸ’ž </h1>
<body>
<p>I'm so in love with you.</p>

<p>And I don't even know how to think about it, because for me, being in love and being in love with <i>you</i>, specifically, are coextensive.</p>


<p>
Even the memory of me first stumbling into the knowledge that I love you is already a murky memory. It seems so strange and so far to me to even imagine that we used to exist with no relation and were not hurtling into each other's love. When it's just us, together, the only reminder of our separate existence, is the separate forces we exert on our dynamic because it feels like we are acting as one.
</p>

<p>
So the only way for me to even describe how much I love you is to just describe you. I love everything about you â€” even your flaws are inseperable from the lovable entirety of you. Being around you makes me love everything around me, because it is evidence of us being together.
</p>

<p>
I think since first dating, I've always felt a particular joy in your existence, something like your soul feels almost tangible to me and I want to grab onto it and hug it whenever we are together. Maybe this is love? You exude care and attention to so much around you, that you seem to expand to take up the space you are in. First of all, this makes your jokes perfectly timed and placed, and your opinions very strong, because they too, come from a sort of love. Second, it helps anchor me to my surroundings and the present whenever I am with you, because we are together in the present and in one specific place, so that becomes the most important time and place. I feel even when we are not together it helps anchor me to my surroundings to think about the sorts of things you might enjoy and pay attention to and helps me lead a more joyful life.
</p>


<p>i love how you are always evolving and changing</p>
<p>i love being high with you</p>
<p>i love observing people with you</p>
<p>i love how you think of me over the course of the day</p>
<p>i love when you dislike things because you love something else</p>
<p>i love making friends together</p>
<p>i love how we are always changing each other</p>
<p>i love how we love to do nothing together</p>
<p>i love how we are always finding new songs</p>
<p>i love listening to love song lyrics and thinking about how they are obviously about you</p>
<p>i love myself around you</p>
<p>i love how you are always with me</p>
<p>i love thinking about our past, present, and future</p>
