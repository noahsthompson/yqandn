<h1> Merry Christmas </h1>

<p>It feels we know each other like ourselves. I think we are obsessed with how well we know each other, because to us, this is the most tangible evidence of how much we love each other, and I think we are really good at it. Complexities of the nature of past trauma or senses of humor are the best because they are so subtle. I love when something happens and I immediately understand why you think itâ€™s funny and how to make the situation even funnier, or when I can understand when something may be painful for you and I can care for you. When these situations arise it can feel like we are continuous extensions of each other which I love because it is the opposite of feeling lonely. But we also like to scare each other sometimes, me suddenly acting like a crocodile or you saying something a bit horrible on purpose. It allows us to be much wiser and funnier together. I am looking forward to being scared and surprised by you for many years because I think it will only get funnier, and will only teach us more.</p>

<p>I still remember my early impression of you, before we started dating. I felt that under the surface, you were really intense. And this intensity was somehow attractive to me. I think I was so attracted to you partially because I was just so curious about what could be causing such a buildup of pressure and energy, but I still donâ€™t really know what I was sensing, or if I was just projecting my own repressed desire onto you.</p>

<p>I think when I misunderstand you, it at some level because I misunderstood myself. But at that moment love is the most important thing. It is easy to love you when we are physically touching, but to reach through the barrier between us and care for each other despite a lack of understanding is the greatest instance of love. I believe we will never fully understand each other, but because we love each other even when we are being mysterious or weird I know that our love is powerful and resilient. There is nothing that could change it.</p>

<p>I love how you smell like sunlight. 
You laugh with joy and move with wisdom. 
We are a binary star system, bound to each other and dancing until death.</p>

<h1> ðŸ’ž Happy Valentine's Day ðŸ’ž </h1>
<body>
<p>I'm so in love with you.</p>

<p>And I don't even know how to think about it, because for me, being in love and being in love with <i>you</i>, specifically, are coextensive.</p>


<p>
Even the memory of me first stumbling into the knowledge that I love you is already a murky memory. It seems so strange and so far to me to even imagine that we used to exist with no relation and were not hurtling into each other's love. When it's just us, together, the only reminder of our separate existence, is the separate forces we exert on our dynamic because it feels like we are acting as one.
</p>

<p>
So the only way for me to even describe how much I love you is to just describe you. I love everything about you â€” even your flaws are inseperable from the lovable entirety of you. Being around you makes me love everything around me, because it is evidence of us being together.
</p>

<p>
I think since first dating, I've always felt a particular joy in your existence, something like your soul feels almost tangible to me and I want to grab onto it and hug it whenever we are together. Maybe this is love? You exude care and attention to so much around you, that you seem to expand to take up the space you are in. First of all, this makes your jokes perfectly timed and placed, and your opinions very strong, because they too, come from a sort of love. Second, it helps anchor me to my surroundings and the present whenever I am with you, because we are together in the present and in one specific place, so that becomes the most important time and place. I feel even when we are not together it helps anchor me to my surroundings to think about the sorts of things you might enjoy and pay attention to and helps me lead a more joyful life.

<p>i love being high with you</p>

<p>i love when you dislike things because you love something else</p>
<p>i love making friends together</p>
<p>i love how we are always changing each other</p>
<p>i love how we love to do nothing together</p>

<p>i love myself around you</p>
